I am currently a PhD candidate at PMMH, ESPCI-PSL, working on the elasticity of thin sheets applied to shape morphing materials under the direction of José Bico and Benoît Roman. In parallel, I am working with Alban Sauret on confined suspension flows. Blowing ballons by day, clogging channels by night.

My work focuses on experimental physics and mechanics of fluids, solids, and their interfaces. You can find my previous experiences on my CV [link] and more details on my work either on my research page [link] or through our publications [link].

I will complete my PhD in September 2025 and am actively looking for postdocoral opportunities in soft matter!
