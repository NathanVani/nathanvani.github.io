<p>I am currently a PhD candidate at PMMH, ESPCI-PSL, working on the elasticity of thin sheets applied to shape morphing inflatables under the direction of José Bico and <a href="https://blog.espci.fr/benoitroman/">Benoît Roman</a>. In parallel, I am working with <a href="https://sauretlab.me.ucsb.edu/">Alban Sauret</a> at UMD on confined suspension flows. Blowing ballons by day, clogging channels by night.</p>

<p>I conduct experimental physics research, focusing on the mechanics of fluids, solids, and their interfaces. For my background, refer to my <a href="/assets/docs/NathanVani.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>, or learn more about my current work on my <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/research/">research page</a> or through our <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/publications/">publications</a>.</p>

<p> <strong>I will complete my PhD in September 2025 and am actively looking for postdoctoral opportunities in soft matter!</strong></p>
