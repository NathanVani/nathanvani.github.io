<p>I am currently a PhD candidate at PMMH, ESPCI-PSL, working on the elasticity of thin sheets applied to shape morphing inflatables under the direction of José Bico and <a href="https://blog.espci.fr/benoitroman/">Benoît Roman</a>. We apply fundamental beam theory to model networks of tubes, and have found some cool results <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20511">about bending boundary layers</a> along the way.</p>
  
<p>In parallel, I have been working with <a href="https://sauretlab.me.ucsb.edu/">Alban Sauret</a> at UMD on suspension flows. Our main project investigates the statistics of arch formation of flowing non-colloidal particle systems.</p>

<p>Blowing ballons by day, clogging channels by night: experimental physics on the mechanics of fluids, solids, and their interfaces. You can find more personal background on my <a href="/assets/docs/NathanVani.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and illustrations in the <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/gallery/">gallery</a>, or perhaps read our <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/publications/">publications</a>.</p>

<p> <strong>I will complete my PhD in September 2025 and am actively looking for postdoctoral opportunities in soft matter!</strong></p>
