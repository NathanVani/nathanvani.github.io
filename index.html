<p>I am currently a PhD candidate at PMMH, ESPCI-PSL, working on the elasticity of thin sheets applied to shape morphing materials under the direction of José Bico and <a href="https://blog.espci.fr/benoitroman/">Benoît Roman</a>. In parallel, I am working with Alban Sauret on confined suspension flows. Blowing ballons by day, clogging channels by night.</p>

<p>My work focuses on experimental physics and mechanics of fluids, solids, and their interfaces. You can find my previous experiences on my <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/cv/">CV</a> and more details on my work either on my <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/research/">research page</a> or through our <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/publications/">publications</a>.</p>

<p> <strong>I will complete my PhD in September 2025 and am actively looking for postdoctoral opportunities in soft matter!</strong></p>
