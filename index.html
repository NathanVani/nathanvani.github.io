<p>I recently defended my Ph.D. at PMMH, ESPCI-PSL, working on the elasticity of thin sheets inflatables under the direction of <a href="https://blog.espci.fr/jbico/">José Bico</a> and <a href="https://blog.espci.fr/benoitroman/">Benoît Roman</a>. We applied fundamental beam theory to model networks of tubes, and have found some cool results <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2426748122">about bending boundary layers</a> along the way.</p>
  
<p>In parallel, I have been working with <a href="https://sauretlab.me.ucsb.edu/">Alban Sauret</a> at UMD on suspension flows. Our main project investigates the <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/sm/d2sm00962e">statistics of arch formation</a> in non-colloidal particle systems.</p>

<p>I have now joined the University of Amsterdam as a postdoctoral researcher working with Daniel Bonn.

<p>Blowing ballons by day, clogging channels by night: experimental physics on the mechanics of fluids, solids, and their interfaces. You can find my personal background through my <a href="/assets/docs/NathanVani.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and illustrations in the <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/gallery/">gallery</a>, or perhaps read our <a href="https://nathanvani.github.io/publications/">publications</a>.</p>
